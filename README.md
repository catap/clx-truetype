## clx-truetype

Pure Common Lisp TrueType antialiased fonts rendering using
[CLX](https://github.com/sharplispers/clx) and the Xrender extension.

Although a fork, this repository is to be [considered the **principal**
clx-truetype fork](https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm/discussions/1109)
and the de facto continuation of the development effort.
Initially, clx-truetype was written by
[Mikhail Filonenko](https://github.com/filonenko-mikhail). Over the years,
however, additions and fixes have mainly happened across different forks as
Mikhail's own repository has disappeared. This repository therefore
consolidates these changes, provides proper versioning and strives to
remain active.

clx-truetype is especially important for users of
[StumpWM](https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm) because it allows the window
manager to display text using TTF fonts. To use StumpWM with clx-truetype
you have to install the
[ttf-fonts](https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm-contrib/tree/master/util/ttf-fonts)
contrib module. The usage of the module is beyond this documentation.
